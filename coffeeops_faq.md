Q) Are certifications important?
<Patrick's Personal Position>  As you get later in your career, certs matter less and you can go your entire career without having to produce a cert but there can be some benefits:

a - Signaling to an employer that you have done some work on this and can focus long enough to study
b - Provides a good framework to study off of though taking the exam is optional
c - Differentiates you from other novices, BUT is not a substitute for problem solving experience

Q) Are job titles important?
<PPP> Depends on your own definition of success and context of the organization.
  
  Titles may provide you with a sense of career progression that has the very real benefit of motivating you to stick with the career for longer.  It can be an incremental chain of milestones to help you break down a really big goal.  Titles can potentially help you bargain for higher salary when changing companies.  However, in CoffeeOps discussions we've come to agree that titles are not consistent across companies and industries.  In some companies, your title never changes even as you become more senior.  Recruiters are probably catching on to this.
  
  Titles may have importance in the context of your organization.  It may empower you to lead a large team to pursuit an initiative.  It may give you authority to spend over a certain budget on a tool or hire a new employee.  It is less about personal pride but more about hierarchy.


Q) How do we develop a culture of remote work?
