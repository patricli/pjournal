## Space
I've recently been very curious about this concept of space - a space of time and a physical space.

A space in time is a moment to be deliberate.  It can be a space of time you hold for daily reflection and mediation.  It can be a space devoted to excercise time or reading time.  Its actual space that I block off on my digital calendar.  Steve Covey repeated talks about the "space" between stimulus and response.  By leaving a space, you can avoid regretable knee-jerk reactions.  You can calibrate, include context, maybe involve compassion, before you respond.  It also add a buffer to de-escalate the response so we don't take damaging actions.  Add space in time instead of automatically turning to our phone for a mindless hit of dopamine gives us a moment to return back to the task at hand.  Adding "empty space" to be bored allows our diffuse attention to mull things over in the background and generate creative ideas and connections.  It seems we don't create space in our time and it has resulted in our lack of doing the deliberate and important thing for the day.  

I've also begun to consider physical space as a key to shift mental states.  Perhaps this can be substituted with music or smells but the physical space is a powerful one.  I get the advice to just use my bed for sleep or I will have trouble associating it with time to fall alseep.  I hear to keep my phone and electronic lights out of the bedroom to avoid things that inadvertantly keep us awake.  So maybe I need a dedicated space for sleep, a dedicated space for work, and a dedicated space to disconnect.  That is quite a premium for living in NYC.  I am curious about how I can better use my space to shift into peak performance in each state.


## Gratitude as an Emotion

My friend gave a mindfulness webinar and said "gratitude is unique emotion".  I didn't think of gratitude and gratitude practice as an emotion before this but it is an interesting notion.  I definitely feel it's not like other emotions that may be more active.  Gratitude seems reactive.  It seems to come from reflecting on what's already happened.  When I think about gratitude and this meme of parents saying "You should be grateful", it actually feels like a precursor to the emotion of shame.  So a healthy gratitude practice should not bring about shame.  Personally, I sense that it emimates from a deep and warm place inside myself that brings a calmness over my body.  But somehow the word triggers emotions of lacking and incompetance.  

Shame... something that feels terrible but if you lack it, you are labeled a psychopath.  Shame seems to stem from conscientiousness and trying to abide by social norms.  However, social norms change with time and place.  Shame is a hard one to get right.


## Meaning

Homework assignment - where do I find meaning?
I find meaning in doing something hard - like solving a rock climbing problem with clean beta.
I find meaning by being in service to others, although that feeling of service can shift from care to obligation.
One I do for myself, the other I do for other people.  However, deriving meaning from the attention of others can be a slippery slope.  My current solution is to identify what is the service I want to provide and stick to it so I don't get dragged down into "one more thing".
