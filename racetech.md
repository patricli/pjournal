"let us call “race as technology” a disruptive technology that changes the terms of engagement with an all-too familiar system of representation and power"

racial positions constructed as a tool

"its distinction lies in its speed of change, its sliding value, its apparent and invisible differences"

"Creating a distance from the inherited logic of race, conceptualizing race as technology enables an aesthetics and an ethics
of race: an agent can judge the strategic value of one mode of
representation over another"

a rigorous conception of race suggests that agency is possible within repressive systems and that this agency often renegotiates the tools of mastery

I ask the reader to rest with the formula: race as a technology—as a prosthesis of sorts—adds functionality to the subject, helps form
location, and provides information.

Race as technology formulates race as a productive aspect of human subjectivity that is contingent to use or application, like a tool

Race transformed from a biological category in the 18th century to an anthropological category in the 19th century.

the best way to fight racism might not be to deny the existence of race but to make race do different things


# Race as Technology

This has been a confusing subject for me.  After reading several source materials, I interpret the perspective as race is not a technology like a machine but more general as a tool to be leveraged (often for bad but potentially for good).  

The text has shown race when from something that was biologically defined to something that is now culturally defined.  The "race" of "white" did not really exist until the American colonies as imigrants came from European countries and were rebranded white so as not be be subjected to the lower caste of black.  In their home country, they were German, Irish, Scottish, Polish.  There is no ethnic orgin of "white".  And certainly people who were brought over to America as slaves did not consider themselves as black but as their native ethnic groups and tribes.  For a second, I almost verded into reflecting them as nationals from African countries but those countries were politically devised to break up traditional lineages.  

To me, race as technology may best be thought of as a feature, used to classify and be treated as a unit of work.  It has been leveraged unethically to assign distasteful work to a race / group of people that are told they are inferior, so to create a reason why they must be limited to this work.  This has produced oncomes where the "inferior race" has been leveraged for production and economic benefit for the system.  While this is one possble structure, it is not the most ideal due to the inequalities of treatment.  However, it does address how to move an industrialized venture forward and be competitive.  In England, there were 12 hour factory workers and child labor.  In America, slave labor built up the colonies and plantations.  History repeats this pattern of the working class and the ruling elite that makes the both ventures forward.

So how can race as a technology be used for good?  One possibility is recognizing different perspectives and need across race can help to create a more complete solution.  One seemingly funny misstep in technology were motion sensors that could not sense black people to open doors or dispense soap.  There was obviously a flaw in the technology that it could not sense different variation of pigment in skin.  This flaw as also repeated in the Apple Watch who's heart rate monitor did not work on black people.  This means they companies are not capturing the full market opportunity.  But it can also signify the need to get input across this cateorgization of race to create better solutions.  

I am still looking for examples on how race as a technology can be more unifying than divicive.  Race itself does not judge either way, it has been the culture that has encoded values of plus and minus to the data threaded by race.
