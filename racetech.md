"let us call “race as technology” a disruptive technology that changes the terms of engagement with an all-too familiar system of representation and power"

racial positions constructed as a tool

"its distinction lies in its speed of change, its sliding value, its apparent and invisible differences"

"Creating a distance from the inherited logic of race, conceptualizing race as technology enables an aesthetics and an ethics
of race: an agent can judge the strategic value of one mode of
representation over another"

a rigorous conception of race suggests that agency is possible within repressive systems and that this agency often renegotiates the tools of mastery

I ask the reader to rest with the formula: race as a technology—as a prosthesis of sorts—adds functionality to the subject, helps form
location, and provides information.

Race as technology formulates race as a productive aspect of human subjectivity that is contingent to use or application, like a tool

Race transformed from a biological category in the 18th century to an anthropological category in the 19th century.
